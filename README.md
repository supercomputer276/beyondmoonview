# Pok&eacute;mon: Beyond Moonview
## an Eclipse Origins MMORPG

<b>Status:</b> Still setting stuff up. Just have the starting area so far.

<b>For those who do not have a Git client:</b> The game client and runtime installer can be downloaded using "Download ZIP" on the right side of the window. Note that if you're updating, you probably want to just download Client/data files/PKMN_Moonview, which is going to have the stuff that actually changes.

## About

<i>Pok&eacute;mon: Beyond Moonview</i> is a 2D MMORPG made using Eclipse Origins 4.0, made as something that my friends and I could just hang out on together. The entire client is being put up here because I don't think that version is available from their website anymore.

The setting is a Pok&eacute;mon-only world centered more or less around Mt. Moonview and the big building near its peak, Moonview Observatory. Around and beyond the mountain is a world full of adventure, treasure, and danger... or at least there will be once it's made. Complete with even random dungeons!

<b>Notes on controls:</b> You can move with either the arrow keys or by left-clicking an open tile to go there. Right-click to attack or interact with the environment or other characters.
